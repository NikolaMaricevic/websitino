# Websitino

A lightweight static file server for local development. Perfect for testing static websites and serving files with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Tiny footprint**: Only ~1.5MB, no external dependencies
- **Zero installation**: Single portable executable
- **Fast & efficient**: Built for performance
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS and Windows
- **Secure by default**: Hidden files/directories not served unless explicitly enabled

## Download & build

You can download pre-built binaries for your operating system directly from the [download page](https://trikko.github.io/websitino/).

Alternatively, if you have the [D programming language](https://dlang.org) compiler installed, you can build and run the project with: `dub run websitino`


## Usage

Run `websitino` in your project directory to start serving files immediately.

To enable directory listing, use `websitino --list-dirs`. You can also use `websitino --index` to automatically serve index.html files when present in directories.

For a complete list of available options, run `websitino --help`.
